Factory Method

Defines an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses to decide which class to instantiate
Refers to the newly created object through a common interface

the Factory Method is related to the idea on which libraries work: a library uses abstract classes for defining and maintaining relations between objects. One type of responsibility is creating such objects. The library knows when an object needs to be created, but not what kind of object it should create, this being specific to the application using the library.
